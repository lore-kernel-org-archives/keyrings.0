David might want to use the audit label for this, I don't know.
And maybe that's a good choice initially.

But going way off topic.

Because there is a need to not clutter kernel space with logging,
leaving it to user space to handle but also without providing user
space with sufficient information to do so there will need to be
some sort of globally unique (sub-system) identifiers of kernel
objects for which user space needs logging information so that
if or when that kernel to user space information flow is
implemented the consistent identifiers that will be needed will
at least exist for some kernel objects.

Yes, that's way off topic for this series but I think it's something
that needs at least some consideration for new implementation work.

Unfortunately properly implementing such an encoding scheme probably
warrants a completely separate project so, as you say moot wrt. this
series.
