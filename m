Is there precedent for this config file format? It looks like possible
YAML, but this patch doesn't mention that anywhere. Is there a good
reason to not be using an existing format (ini, toml, json, shell-alike,
anything)? I have no preference for anything other than a format that
already exists out there. Maybe one that supports comments too so that
these settings can have context associated with them in real
deployments (which effectively rules out json)?

So it does support comments...

...but not if it starts with whitespace. So if one does indent the
`default_ttl` setting for whatever reason, the comment is stuck at the
first column.

But no trailing whitespace is allowed?

The valid range should be mentioned in the docs (basically that 0 is not
allowed and has no special meaning (it could mean leaving off the TTL as
previously done)).

Forwards compatibility is hard with such behavior. Is there any reason
this can't be a warning?

There's no mention of the leading whitespace support or comments here.
Does the file deserve its own manpage?
