So I no longer hate the implementation, but I do want to see the
actual user space users come out of the woodwork and try this out for
their use cases.

I'd hate to see a new event queue interface that people then can't
really use due to it not fulfilling their needs, or can't use for some
other reason.

We've had a fair number of kernel interfaces that ended up not being
used all that much, but had one or two minor users and ended up being
nasty long-term maintenance issues.. I don't want this to become yet
another such one.
