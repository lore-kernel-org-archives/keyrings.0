The 'select CRYPTO' is actually still needed because CRYPTO_LIB_CHACHA20POLY1305
is under the CRYPTO menuconfig:

make allnoconfig
cat >> .config << EOF
CONFIG_SHMEM=y
CONFIG_TMPFS=y
CONFIG_KEYS=y
CONFIG_BIG_KEYS=y
EOF
make olddefconfig

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for CRYPTO_LIB_CHACHA20POLY1305
  Depends on [n]: CRYPTO [=n] && (CRYPTO_ARCH_HAVE_LIB_CHACHA [=n] || !CRYPTO_ARCH_HAVE_LIB_CHACHA [=n]) && (CRYPTO_ARCH_HAVE_LIB_POLY1305 [=n] || !CRYPTO_ARCH_HAVE_LIB_POLY1305 [=n])
  Selected by [y]:
  - BIG_KEYS [=y] && KEYS [=y] && TMPFS [=y]


Maybe the 'source "lib/crypto/Kconfig"' in crypto/Kconfig should be moved to
lib/Kconfig so that it's under "Library routines" and the crypto library options
can be selected without the full CRYPTO framework?

But lib/crypto/libchacha.c uses crypto_xor_cpy(), and
lib/crypto/chacha20poly1305.c uses crypto_memneq().  So those functions would
first need to be pulled into lib/crypto/ too.

There should be a 'memzero_explicit(buf, enclen);' before the above two calls to
kvfree().

Or even better these should use kvfree_sensitive(), but that hasn't been merged
yet.  It was under discussion last month:
https://lkml.kernel.org/lkml/20200407200318.11711-1-longman@redhat.com/

-EINVAL is often unclear, since everyone uses it for everything.  How about
using -EBADMSG, which is what was used before via crypto_aead_decrypt()?

Likewise, the buffer should be zeroed before freeing here.
