Not sure I parsed your message correctly, but that comment there was a
suggestion from Eric several months ago when I first posted it. The
idea is that the key shouldn't be reused with the same nonce, so in
case somebody ambitious comes along and tries to add an .update
function, they'll be reminded to take this into account. Alternatively
they might choose to just generate a new key, which is fine too.
Either way, it's a useful warning to have in place.
