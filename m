    cifs: Always resolve hostname before reconnecting

    In case a hostname resolves to a different IP address (e.g. long
    running mounts), make sure to resolve it every time prior to calling
    generic_ip_connect() in reconnect.
...

(Note that this patch may have some minor dependencies on a few other
DFS related patches that were merged immediately before it.
