It's possible to have a key type in a module.  In fact, some of the existing key
types such as key_type_rxrpc can already be modular.  But I don't think it
really works as intended currently because there is no autoloading of key type
modules.  That is, if big_key was a module and you tried to add a key of type
"big_key", the big_key module would *not* be automatically loaded, so the call
would return -ENODEV.  This could be fixed, I believe.

(I also still need to convince myself that there aren't any race conditions in
key type unregistering.  It's a little weird how it changes the key type to the
".dead" key type, rather than pinning the key type in memory while it's still
used.)
