Agreed. For example:

The Linux NFS client won't connect to a new server when the server's
DNS information changes. A fresh mount operation would be needed for
the client to recognize and make use of it.

There are mechanisms in the NFSv4 protocol to collect server IP addresses
from the server itself (fs_locations) and then try those locations if the
current server fails to respond. But currently that is not implemented in
Linux (and servers would need to be ready to provide that kind of update).

Our NFS colleagues working on Solaris have noted that handling the expiry
of DNS information can be tricky. It is usually desirable to continue using
expired information when a new DNS query fails temporarily (times out, or
the network is partitioned, etc). That makes for a more robust network file
service.

I thought that NFSv4.1 and newer have server-provided unique information
that might be used in place of the server's IP address. This information
is supposed to be independent of a server's network addresses.
