Somewhat incredibly, it works perfectly.

First I tried the instructions you noted, and things worked, both for
big files and small ones.

Then I modified the source to print to dmesg the data buffer and the
key before and after the encryption/decryption function. I verified
with a small python script that indeed standard aes-gcm is being used
successfully.

Thus, pending Ted's approval of the new random API, this patch should
be ready for merging.

Regards,
Jason
