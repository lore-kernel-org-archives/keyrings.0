Hello David,

I didn't know about asymmetric key type so I looked it up, from my
observation, it would not be possible to use it for the caam_tk as
we must perform operations on the data provided.
The name " asymmetric " is also misleading for the use we would have.

The trusted and encrypted does not provides the necessary
callbacks to do what we would need or require huge modifications.

I would like, for this series to focus on the change related to
dm-crypt. In effect, it is currently not possible to pass a key
from the asymmetric key type to it.

Franck
