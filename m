That means that the latency of both is added together and causes the first
mount to take longer - though as long as you have a local DNS cache, that's
fine.

AFS will switch servers at the next operation if the server list changes.  And
if the current op tries to access an old server and gets bounced, this should
trigger an immediate reevaluation.  It also regularly probes the servers and
interfaces it knows about to find which one's accessible and which has the
best response and can switch servers on that basis also.

I should also note that AFS deletes the dns_resolver key after reading it and
maintains the expiry information in its internal structs.

Note also that in AFS this only applies to locating the Volume Location
servers (which is a layer of abstraction that hides which server(s) a volume
resides on and what their addresses are).  The VL service is queried to find
out where file servers are (giving you their addresses itself so you don't
need to access the DNS there).

If the record never expires (the current case), the address lookup in the
kernel (dns_query()) will always return the same address until someone
manually evicts it.

Otherwise, once the record expires, the kernel will just upcall again.

You might be right - certainly for NFS and CIFS where the address ascribed to
a superblock is hard to change as it partly defines the superblock.  Change
the address and your superblock in now a different thing as far as the VFS is
concerned.

This makes fscache indexing tricky for NFS.  How do you define a superblock?
Is it address?  Is it hostname?  What happens if one or the other changes?
What happens if there are two or more addresses (say ipv4 and ipv6 addrs)?

AFS defined some abstractions for this: the cell name and the volume ID
number.  The physical location of the volume doesn't matter - and the volume
can even be moved around whilst in use.
