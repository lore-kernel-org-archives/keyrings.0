I noticed that too, but I cynically supposed the flaw in the old code
could carry over to the new code without too much difficulty... But
sure, I'll fix this.

This is a real flaw with the crypto API, IMHO. It seems like the key
should be part of the request rather than the tfm. I understand some
primitives can do per-key precomputations, but still, this is a real
wart.

Will be fixed in the next revision.

I didn't really want to do sizeof with a VLA, but actually, it looks
like gcc does the right thing, so I'll make that change.

Blah, I really dislike doing that. Can I just roll it into the RNG
patchset, and then it'll go into Ted's tree with DavidH's sign-off?

Great idea, again.

Thanks a bunch for the review!
