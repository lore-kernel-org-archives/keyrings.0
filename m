Typical DNS TTL values are on the order of a day but it can vary widely.
There's really no correct answer for this, since you have no way to tell
how long the entry has been sitting in the DNS server's cache before you
queried for it.

So, you're probably down to just finding some value that doesn't hammer
the DNS server too much, but that allows you to get new entries in a
reasonable amount of time.

10 mins sounds like a reasonable default to me.
