We have a very similar system in CIFS. Failover can be handled in 2 ways
(technically both can be used at the same time):

a) with DFS, the mount can have a list of possible location to connect
   to, sort of like cross-server symlinks with multiple possible
   targets. Note that the target value uses hostnames.
b) the domain controler can notice the server is down and automatically
   switch the server hostname DNS entry to a backup one with a different IP.

When we try to reconnect after a failure (using (a) or just reconnecting
to same server) we resolve the host again to try to use any new IP (in
case (b) happened). This is done via upcalling using the request_key()
API.

The cifs.upcall prog (from cifs-utils) calls getaddrinfo() and sets a
key with a default TTL of 10mn [2][3] but if the system uses DNS caching
via nscd[1] there's no way to tell how long the old IP will remain in
use...
