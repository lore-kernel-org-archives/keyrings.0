Now this has hit mainline, the "BIG_KEYS" Kconfig symbol appeared on my
radar. Is there any reason this cannot be tristate?

The help text says:

    This option provides support for holding large keys within the kernel
    (for example Kerberos ticket caches).  The data may be stored out to
    swapspace by tmpfs.

    If you are unsure as to whether this is required, answer N.

So to save kernel size, I wan't to save N, but for a distro kernel that might
have Kerberos users, you currently need to say Y, while M would be nicer.

The symbol seems to just control the build of security/keys/big_key.c,
which could use module_init() in the modular case.
I'm not sending a patch to change BIG_KEYS from bool to tristate, as this is
crypto, and I don't understand the full implications.

Thanks!
