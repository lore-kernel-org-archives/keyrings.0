I guess I'd have to do that in parallel.  Would calling something like
res_mkquery() use local DNS caching?

It depends on the filesystem.

AFS keeps track of the expiration on the record and will issue a new lookup
when the data expires, but NFS doesn't make use of this information.  The
keyring subsystem will itself dispose of dns_resolver keys that expire and
request_key() will only upcall again if the key has expired.

The problem for NFS is that the host IP address is the primary key for the
superblock (see nfs_compare_super_address()).

CIFS also doesn't make direct use of the TTL, and again this may be because it
uses the server address as part of the primary key for the superblock (see
cifs_match_super()).
